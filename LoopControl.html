<!-- JavaScript provides full control to handle loops and switch statements. There may be a situation when
 you need to come out of a loop without reaching its bottom. There may also be a situation when you
  want to skip a part of your code block and start the next iteration of the loop.

To handle all such situations, JavaScript provides break and continue statements. These statements 
are used to immediately come out of any loop or to start the next iteration of any loop respectively. -->
