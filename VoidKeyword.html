<!-- void is an important keyword in JavaScript which can be used as a unary operator that appears
 before its single operand, which may be of any type. This operator specifies an expression to be
  evaluated without returning a value. -->

  <!-- The most common use of this operator is in a client-side javascript: URL, where it allows you to 
  evaluate an expression for its side-effects without the browser displaying the value of the evaluated
   expression.

Here the expression alert ('Warning!!!') is evaluated but it is not loaded back into the current document âˆ’ -->
