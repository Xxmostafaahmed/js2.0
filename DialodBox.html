<!-- JavaScript supports three important types of dialog boxes. These dialog boxes can be used to
 raise and alert, or to get confirmation on any input or to have a kind of input from the users.
  Here we will discuss each dialog box one by one.

Alert Dialog Box
An alert dialog box is mostly used to give a warning message to the users. For example, if one 
input field requires to enter some text but the user does not provide any input, then as a part 
of validation, you can use an alert box to give a warning message.

Nonetheless, an alert box can still be used for friendlier messages. Alert box gives only one button
 "OK" to select and proceed. -->
