<!-- What are Cookies ?
Web Browsers and Servers use HTTP protocol to communicate and HTTP is a stateless protocol.
 But for a commercial website, it is required to maintain session information among different pages.
  For example, one user registration ends after completing many pages. But how to maintain users' 
  session information across all the web pages. -->


  <!-- How It Works ?
Your server sends some data to the visitor's browser in the form of a cookie. The browser may accept
 the cookie. If it does, it is stored as a plain text record on the visitor's hard drive. Now, when the visitor
  arrives at another page on your site, the browser sends the same cookie to the server for retrieval.
   Once retrieved, your server knows/remembers what was stored earlier.

Cookies are a plain text data record of 5 variable-length fields −

Expires − The date the cookie will expire. If this is blank, the cookie will expire when the visitor quits
 the browser.

Domain − The domain name of your site.

Path − The path to the directory or web page that set the cookie. This may be blank if you want to retrieve
 the cookie from any directory or page.

Secure − If this field contains the word "secure", then the cookie may only be retrieved with a secure server.
 If this field is blank, no such restriction exists.

Name=Value − Cookies are set and retrieved in the form of key-value pairs -->

<!-- Storing Cookies
The simplest way to create a cookie is to assign a string value to the document.cookie object, which looks like this.

document.cookie = "key1 = value1;key2 = value2;expires = date"; -->


<html>
   <head>   
      <script type = "text/javascript">
         <!--
            function WriteCookie() {
               if( document.myform.customer.value == "" ) {
                  alert("Enter some value!");
                  return;
               }
               cookievalue = escape(document.myform.customer.value) + ";";
               document.cookie = "name=" + cookievalue;
               document.write ("Setting Cookies : " + "name=" + cookievalue );
            }
         //-->
      </script>      
   </head>
   
   <body>      
      <form name = "myform" action = "">
         Enter name: <input type = "text" name = "customer"/>
         <input type = "button" value = "Set Cookie" onclick = "WriteCookie();"/>
      </form>   
   </body>
